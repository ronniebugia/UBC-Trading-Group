The US-China Trade War
October 23, 2018 

So Far: President Donald Trump in his election promised to make trade fair for America, striking a trade war with its biggest trading partners, the most recent one being China. The US has imposed three rounds of tariffs on $250bn worth of Chinese products. To which China has countered that with a $60bn tariff imposition.

For President Xi Jinping this is a critical political time, especially to preserve national pride, standing up to the US bullying and maintaining the very important trade partner of the Chinese economy.
        
Currently the US trade balance with China amounts to $710.4Bn in 2017. Exports of the US to China comprised of $187.5Bn of that and $522.9Bn accounted for Chinaâ€™s export to the US. Leaving the US in a trade deficit with China to $335.4Bn in 2017.
