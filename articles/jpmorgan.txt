JP Morgan Predicts the Next Financial Crisis for 2020
November 4, 2018 

A decade after the infamous collapse of Lehman Brothers we are now starting to think when the next recession is going to hit. J.P. Morgan strategists John Normand and Federico Manicardi may have found the answer to this question and they reckon investors should mark their calendars for 2020.

The J.P. Morgan model takes into account different sets of outcomes based on indicators ranging from consumer and business sentiment to asset-price valuations, leverage and compensation growth. Assuming an average length recession, the model also predicts a 20% slide in U.S stocks, a 48% slide in emerging market stocks as well as a jump in U.S corporate bond yields of about 1.15 percentage points. 

So, should we start to worry? The good news is that the next financial crisis will likely be smaller in scale and somewhat less painful than the one in 2008. However, the structurally low market liquidity that weâ€™re currently experiencing may be considered as the dangerous wildcard.
