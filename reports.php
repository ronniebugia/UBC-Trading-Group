        <h1 style="font-size:1.5em;"><b>J.P Morgan Predicts the Next Financial Crisis for 2020</b></h1>
        <p>November 4, 2018 <br>
        A decade after the infamous collapse of Lehman Brothers we are now starting to think when the next recession is going to hit. J.P. Morgan strategists John Normand and Federico Manicardi may have found the answer to this question and they reckon investors should mark their calendars for 2020. </p>
        <p>The J.P. Morgan model takes into account different sets of outcomes based on indicators ranging from consumer and business sentiment to asset-price valuations, leverage and compensation growth. Assuming an average length recession, the model also predicts a 20% slide in U.S stocks, a 48% slide in emerging market stocks as well as a jump in U.S corporate bond yields of about 1.15 percentage points. </p>
        <p>So, should we start to worry? The good news is that the next financial crisis will likely be smaller in scale and somewhat less painful than the one in 2008. However, the structurally low market liquidity that we’re currently experiencing may be considered as the dangerous wildcard.</p>

        <h1 style="font-size:1.5em;"><b>The US-China Trade War</b></h1>
        <p>October 23, 2018 <br>
        So Far: President Donald Trump in his election promised to make trade fair for America, striking a trade war with its biggest trading partners, the most recent one being China. The US has imposed three rounds of tariffs on $250bn worth of Chinese products. To which China has countered that with a $60bn tariff imposition.</p>
        <p>For President Xi Jinping this is a critical political time, especially to preserve national pride, standing up to the US bullying and maintaining the very important trade partner of the Chinese economy.</p>
        <p>Currently the US trade balance with China amounts to $710.4Bn in 2017. Exports of the US to China comprised of $187.5Bn of that and $522.9Bn accounted for China’s export to the US. Leaving the US in a trade deficit with China to $335.4Bn in 2017.</p>
